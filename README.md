# BottleRockets

Experiments in bottle rocket simulations.


# Getting  started

1. Install python 3.7
1. `git clone https://github.com/avisagie/BottleRockets.git`
1. `cd BottleRockets`
1. `virtualenv virt`
1. `virt\Scripts\activate.bat`
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. `python -u fly.py`

Then check out fly.py, edit it with new parameters and have fun!
also check out rocket_architectures.py. There are two (at the time of writing):
one with a center stage and three boosters and one with a single stage.

fly*_ga.py try to optimise rocket parameters with a Genertic
Algorithm.
